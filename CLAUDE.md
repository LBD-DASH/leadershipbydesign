### n8n Workflows
- Ollama scoring + Apollo enrichment pipeline
- Results sent to `ruflo-update-lead` function
- Classifications: `ruflo_path`, `buying_intent_score`, `buyer_type`

### Lead Sources
- **Apollo.io** — Primary prospecting source (API search + sequences)
- **Web Scraper** — Firecrawl-powered company/contact discovery
- **Vibe Prospecting** — Active lead source, connected via MCP for enrichment and prospect matching
- **Buying Signal Hunter** — Uses Apollo `api_search` endpoint + Firecrawl for signal detection (fixed: no longer uses Google scraping)
- **Contract Scraper** — Firecrawl scrapes job boards for leadership development contract opportunities
- **Google Ads** — Paid leads via LAC Diagnostic funnel

## Key Database Tables
- `warm_outreach_queue` — main prospect queue (source_keyword tracks origin)
- `apollo_sequence_tracking` — Apollo sequence engagement data
- `apollo_sequence_templates` — email templates synced to Apollo
- `pipeline_deals` — CRM pipeline
- `prospect_outreach` — sent email log
- `leader_as_coach_assessments` — LAC diagnostic completions
- `admin_settings` — campaign config (booking_link, campaign_mode)
- `conversion_snapshots` — point-in-time snapshots of funnel conversion metrics
- `outreach_insights` — aggregated outreach performance data (open rates, reply rates, template effectiveness)

## Email Configuration
- **From**: `Kevin Britz <hello@leadershipbydesign.co>`
- **Reply-to**: `hello@leadershipbydesign.co` (forwards to kevin@kevinbritz.com)
- **Provider**: Resend
- **Cold email style**: Under 80 words, no corporate language, no flattery, written as Kevin (first person "I")
- **A/B template variants**: `problem-pattern` (pain-point opener), `question-hook` (curiosity question), `stat-lead` (data-driven opener) — auto-outreach rotates between these

## Industry Rotation (every 3 days)
Both `apollo-prospect-import` and `web-scraper-leads` rotate through these groups:
0. Professional Services (Accounting, Legal, Staffing, HR, Professional Training)
1. Technology & Telecoms
2. Manufacturing & Engineering
3. Retail & FMCG
4. Healthcare & Pharma
5. Construction & Real Estate
6. Logistics & Mining
7. Media & Hospitality

## Google Ads Integration
- GTM conversion tracking v4 live
- Flow: Google Ad click → LAC Diagnostic → Conversion fires back to Google → Agents prioritise lead (score 95) → 2-min fast nurture → PAID LEAD Slack alert → Call
- Paid leads get highest priority in outreach queue

## LinkedIn Automation (~/lbd-agents/)
- Direct LinkedIn REST API posting (no Zapier)
- Schedule: Sun–Thu, random time 06:30–08:30 SAST
- Content pipeline: pre-written posts in `data/linkedin_posts_mar_apr_2026.md`
- Tracking: `data/linkedin_posted.json`
- Token expires ~60 days from creation (needs refresh mechanism)

## Contract Scraper (~/contract-scraper/)
- Firecrawl scrapes 30+ job boards + Google search queries
- Ollama/Mistral classifies results locally
- Posts leads to Slack, saves to `results.json`
- Recency filter: only jobs posted within 7 days
- URL validation: rejects dead links, listing pages, article URLs

## Outreach Strategy (as of March 28 2026)
**Diagnostic-first cold outreach** — shifted from programme-pitch to diagnostic-first approach.
- Step 1 (Day 1): "quick question about your managers" — drives to LAC diagnostic
- Step 2 (Day 4): "re: quick question about your managers" — social proof (200+ companies)
- Step 3 (Day 9): "one stat that might change your mind" — 30-40% new hire loss stat
- Step 4 (Day 16): "last one from me" — graceful close, link stays live
- Programme selling happens ONLY after diagnostic completion via the 3 nurture sequences
- Old sequences paused: "Leader as Coach — 1 MAR" (0 replies/183), "Leader as Coach — MAR v2" (0 replies/98)
- All diagnostic links UTM-tagged: `utm_source=outreach&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=diagnostic-cold&utm_content=stepN`
- `send-diagnostic-results` edge function: emails branded results with profile-specific recommendations + soft CTA
- `check-prospect-engagement` matches diagnostic completers back to `warm_outreach_queue` and `prospect_companies`, boosts score +30, Slack alerts to #leads-and-signups
- `diagnostic_email_results` table tracks all emailed results with UTM attribution
- Full funnel: outreach email → diagnostic click (tracked) → completion → results emailed → prospect matched → Slack alert → nurture sequence

- **Frameworks**: SHIFT, Leader as Coach, Contagious Identity
- **Stats**: 4,000+ leaders | 30+ organisations | 30+ programmes | 11 years

## Rules for Claude Code
- When modifying any agent/function, always check if ICP targeting is involved and ensure excluded industries are respected
- Never add banks, FSI, insurance, education, or consulting back into any targeting
- All outreach emails must use `hello@leadershipbydesign.co` as reply-to
- Company size filters must stay under 500
- When updating agent prompts or system context, also update `claude-context/index.ts` to keep the live operating system in sync
- Keep Lovable (deploys from `main`) and GitHub aligned — use feature branches + PRs
- Auto-outreach uses `claude-sonnet-4-6-20250610` — do not downgrade
- System heartbeat emails kevin@kevinbritz.com on any detected issues
- LinkedIn posts go out Sun–Thu only, never Friday/Saturday
- When leads reply, agents alert and step back — Kevin handles all direct conversations personally
- After fixing any Supabase edge function, push to GitHub and tell user to redeploy via Lovable
